# Website Clone Collection

Welcome to the **Website Clone Collection** repository! ðŸš€  

This repository is my personal playground for practicing web development by cloning various websites. Each subfolder represents a unique website clone, containing all the necessary files to replicate the original website's appearance and functionality.

## ðŸŒŸ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/` (Root)**: Contains this `README.md` file and other general documentation.  
- **`/<Website Name>`**: Each subfolder represents a cloned website.
